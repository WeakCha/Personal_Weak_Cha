<h2>Introduce Myself
</h2>
<p>Hello! Thanks for stopping for a while. I am Weak Cha, definitely a nickname. My real name is Li Liu and I am a student enrolled in Xiamen University in 2016. I transferred my major from Computer Science to Mathematics in 2017 and I choose to major in Computational Mathematics in 2018. <br />



<br />



My reserach interest lies in Statistical Machine Learning and Optimization.

I would like to apply for Master and Ph.D programs linked with <b>Data Science</b> and <b>Statistics</b>,

including but not limited to Machine Learning and Business Analytics. 

Now I am actively working in Luckin Coffee, an Internet food/beverage company as an algorithm engineer. <br /><br />

During my free time I would like to write articles about my recent learning. 

My aim is to <b>make knowledge eternal on the Internet</b>. 

For me, I always scan my personal blog and have new experience and understanding

even if the article itself is composed on my own. More specific description of

the blog is shown below. <br /><br /> 


</p>
<h2>My Personal Blog 
</h2>
<p>I created my personal blog in July, 2017. Now my personal blog is built on the basis of Zhihu,

a forum similar to <b>Quora</b>. It has covered many core mathematical courses and 

some introductory tutorials of R, LaTeX, Python and Git. For each, I try my best to preserve

all related content with several systematical articles, 

but more detailed and focused on the ideas, my personal thought, 

and the obstacles every green hand may encounter. 

During the last 2 years I have achieved many positive reactions 

and many people comment that my articles are <b>easier to read and comprehend</b> 

compared with many other textbooks. Until November, 2019, it has attracted nearly 8500 followers and 750k reading. <br /><br />

<a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/28617379" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Here</a> is the table of contents of all articles in my blog.


</p>
<h2>For committees finding this page
</h2>
<p>I have devoted much time on personal work related to data science and much time on knowledge sharing work. I believe that my empathy could 

help all fighters fighting with maths, statistics and computer programming, which is beneficial and will definitely be supported

by anyone in society. However, most of the articles are written by Chinese, I am sad to find that you could not feel my work and devotion

due to the gap of language. <br /><br /> 

Fortunately, I have written <i>Matrix Manifold Optimization</i> by English. <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/60473090" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><b>Here</b></a> is the article link. Note that you could find other ones 

because I have put a table of contents on the beginning of that note. <br /><br /> 

I sincerely hope you spend some time reading my summaries and enjoying my humorous and rigorous articles

if you are knowledgable about Chinese. Trust me, you will like them. Thanks.<br /> <br />
