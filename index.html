  <br/>
 <br/>Hello! Thanks for stopping for a while. I am Weak Cha (学弱猹), definitely a nickname. Except for my personal work described in Linkedin, I created a personal blog in July, 2017. Now my personal blog is built on the basis of Zhihu,

a forum similar to <b>Quora</b>. It has covered many core mathematical courses and 

some introductory tutorials of R, LaTeX, Python and Git. For each, I try my best to preserve

all related content with several systematical articles, 

but more detailed and focused on the ideas, my personal thought, 

and the obstacles every green hand may encounter. I believe that my empathy could 

help all fighters fight with maths, statistics and computer programming, which is beneficial and will definitely be supported

by anyone in society. Fortunately, until January, 2020, it has attracted nearly 10000 followers and 900k reading. Many other friends have joined me to publish their own articles in my blog for sharing. 
 <br/> <br/>

However, for sharing reasons, most of the articles are written in Chinese. It is really sad of me to find the huge gap of language

has prevented you from enjoying my interesting blog :( . 

Fortunately, I have written <i>Matrix Manifold Optimization</i> in English. <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/60473090" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><b>Here</b></a> is the article link. Note that you could find other ones 

because I have put a table of contents at the beginning of that note. <br /><br /> 

I sincerely hope you spend some time reading my summaries and enjoying my humorous and rigorous articles by the link of 

table of contents <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/28617379" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><b>here</b></a>

if you are proficient in reading Chinese. Trust me, you will like them. Thanks.<br /> <br />
